## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supra-multiwallet.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the demo application.

## 📋 Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Required - JWT Secret (MUST be 64+ characters for production security)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-that-is-at-least-64-characters-long-for-security

# Required - Application URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Required - Supra Chain ID (6 = testnet, 8 = mainnet)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPRA_CHAIN_ID=6

# Optional - Node Environment (automatically set by hosting platforms)
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 🔐 Generating a Secure JWT_SECRET

**CRITICAL**: Your `JWT_SECRET` must be:
- **At least 64 characters** (longer is better)
- **Cryptographically random**
- **Never committed to git**
- **Different for each environment** (dev, staging, production)

Generate a secure secret using one of these methods:

```bash
# Using Node.js
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"

# Using OpenSSL
openssl rand -hex 64

# Using PowerShell (Windows)
[Convert]::ToBase64String((1..64 | ForEach-Object { Get-Random -Minimum 0 -Maximum 256 }))
```

## 🔧 Core Components

### Wallet Provider
Wrap your application to enable wallet functionality:
```tsx
<WalletProvider>
  {/* Your app */}
</WalletProvider>
```

### Connect Button
Pre-built wallet connection UI:
```tsx
import { WalletConnectButton } from '@/components/WalletConnectButton'

<WalletConnectButton />
```

### Protected Routes
Server-side authentication for wallet-specific pages:
```tsx
// app/protected/[walletAddress]/page.tsx
import { cookies } from 'next/headers';
import { verifyToken } from '@/lib/auth';
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';

export default async function ProtectedPage({ params }: { params: { walletAddress: string } }) {
  const token = cookies().get('authToken')?.value;
  const verified = await verifyToken(token);
  
  // Redirect if not authenticated
  if (!verified) {
    return <div>Unauthorized, requires sign-in to wallet to access this page.</div>;
  }
  
  // Verify wallet address matches
  if (verified.address.toLowerCase() !== params.walletAddress.toLowerCase()) {
    return <div>Unauthorized, requires sign-in to wallet to access this page.</div>;
  }
  
  return <div>Protected content for {verified.address}</div>;
}
```

## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks "Connect Wallet"
2. Wallet provider injected script detected
3. User approves connection in wallet
4. **Backend generates unique cryptographic nonce** (32 bytes)
5. User signs nonce + message with wallet
6. **Backend verifies signature cryptographically**
7. JWT token issued in HttpOnly cookie
8. Subsequent requests authenticated via cookie

### Security Features
- ✅ **HttpOnly Cookies** - Tokens inaccessible to JavaScript, preventing XSS
- ✅ **Secure Flag** - HTTPS-only in production
- ✅ **SameSite: Lax** - CSRF protection
- ✅ **24h Expiration** - Tokens auto-expire appropriately
- ✅ **Cryptographic Nonce** - 32-byte random nonces via Web Crypto API
- ✅ **Ed25519 Signature Verification** - Wallet ownership proof via nacl
- ✅ **Edge Runtime Compatible** - Serverless deployment ready
- ✅ **Jose (JWT)** - Industry-standard JWT library

### 🔍 Security Audit Results

**Last Audited**: October 2024

#### ✅ Implemented Security Features:
- HttpOnly cookie storage
- Secure flag on production
- SameSite CSRF protection
- Cryptographic nonce generation
- Token expiration (24h)
- Edge runtime compatibility

#### ✅ Security Features Implemented:

1. **✅ Signature Verification** 
   - Location: `lib/auth.ts` - `verifyWalletSignature()`
   - Implementation: Ed25519 cryptographic signature verification using nacl
   - Security: Proves wallet ownership before issuing JWT
   - Status: ✅ Implemented and tested

2. **✅ Time-Based Nonce Validation**
   - Location: `lib/auth.ts` - `createNonce()` and `validateNonce()`
   - Implementation: Cryptographically signed, time-based nonces (5-minute expiry)
   - Security: Prevents replay attacks without requiring external storage
   - Upgrade path: Can add KV storage for zero replay window if needed
   - Status: ✅ Implemented and tested

3. **⚠️ Client-side Token Storage** 
   - Location: `hooks/useSupraMultiWallet.ts:937-942`
   - Issue: Legacy code attempts to store token in localStorage
   - Impact: Minor - server-side httpOnly cookie is the source of truth
   - Status: Should be removed in cleanup (non-critical)

#### 📝 Optional Enhancements (PR Welcome!):

Potential security improvements for advanced use cases:
- Upgrading to KV storage for zero replay window (optional)
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints (recommended)
- Token refresh pattern (nice-to-have)
- JWT revocation capability (for advanced use cases)
- Address derivation verification (when Supra SDK provides it)

### Why Client-Side Wallet Signing is Necessary

The authentication flow requires client-side wallet interactions because:
- **Wallet extensions inject into browser** - Only accessible client-side
- **User must approve in wallet UI** - Cannot be done server-side
- **Private keys never leave wallet** - Signatures prove ownership without exposing keys
- **Standard Web3 pattern** - Used by OpenSea, Uniswap, etc.

The security model is:
1. **Challenge-response authentication** - Server generates nonce
2. **Cryptographic proof** - User signs with private key
3. **Server verification** - Server validates signature matches address
4. **Secure token issuance** - JWT stored in httpOnly cookie

This is **secure when properly implemented** (with signature verification).

## 🎨 Customization

### Styling

### Adding More Wallets
The architecture supports adding additional wallet providers. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines.

### Environment Variables
```env
# Required
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here

# Optional
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=testnet
```
